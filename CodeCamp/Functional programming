/* 1. This file has been created for description of basic functional programming. I suppose, that everyone who started learning programming faced with functional programming but at the low level.
Then when your programmers skils improved you started learning the OOP paradigma. But after OOP some programmers return to the functional proggraming. The main goal of this kind of
