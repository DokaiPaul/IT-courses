challenge with OOP. n this chalange I had to all beagle's properties to the Own properties and those properties that don't belonge to the beagle into prototypeProps array.

function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Dog.prototype.numLegs = 4;

let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

let ownProps = [];
let prototypeProps = [];

// Only change code below this line
for (let i in beagle) {
  Dog.hasOwnProperty(i) ? ownProps.push(i) :  prototypeProps.push(i);
}
