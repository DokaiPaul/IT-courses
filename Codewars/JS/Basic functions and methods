// 1. Convert number into the string. We assume, that the input is valid and is the number only. Therefore, I didn't implement the function to check the input

function numberToString(num) {
  return num.toString();
}

// Also, there is another way to perform this kind of task

function numberToString(num) {
  return String(num);
}

//2. This is vice versa task for another one above. I have to convert the string into the number value.
// I assume, that the input is valid. And I've tried to write the function in the arrow 'style'

const stringToNumber = str => parseInt(str);
