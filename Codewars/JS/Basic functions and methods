// 1. Convert number into the string. We assume, that the input is valid and is the number only. Therefore, I didn't implement the function to check the input

function numberToString(num) {
  return num.toString();
}

// Also, there is another way to perform this kind of task

function numberToString(num) {
  return String(num);
}

//2. This is vice versa task for another one above. I have to convert the string into the number value.
// I assume, that the input is valid. And I've tried to write the function in the arrow 'style'

const stringToNumber = str => parseInt(str);

//3. Here I calculated the average sum of numbers in given array. Below is the way to write a classical function with for...in cycle

function findAverage(array) {
  if(array.length === 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  let sum = 0;
  for(let i in array) {
    sum += array[i];
  }
  return sum / array.length;
}

//Also, we can reach the same result by using in-built method in arrays. For instance by reduce method

function findAverag(arr) {
    if(arr.length > 0) {
    return arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / arr.length
    }
    return 0;
}

//4. In this task I should take two arguments and check if the first argument ends with value from second argument.
//At the beginning I wanted to write simple cycle. But I tried to google and I found out that there is built-in function in JS. And I've performed this task by this method

function solution(str, ending){
  return str.endsWith(ending);
}
